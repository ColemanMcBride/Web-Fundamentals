      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this webpage is to provide insight into me and my
        background. It will be a resource that I can use as a resume of sorts,
        to display past projects, experiences, and qualifications.
      </p>
      <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        My audience is future employers or others who may be looking at my
        qualifications and/or experience related to cars or web design.
      </p>

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>CM Automotive</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->
      <img src="images/logo.png" alt="CM Automotive" />

      <h2>Style Guide</h2>

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn. You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <p>Palette URL:</p>
      <a
        href="https://coolors.co/495b40-d1b96b-eff7ff-0b132b-36558f"

        </tr>

        </tr>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Quintessential

      <h3>Brainstorm ideas</h3>
      <p>
        The thought behind this website is that it will be a portfolio depicting
        my automotive-related experience. I have recently decided to change my
        major and thought this would be a useful way to bridge the gap between
        my previous major and my future major. This could be used as a resume of
        sorts, bringing people such as future employers to the website to learn
        more about me and my automotive experiences, while also proving my
        ability as a web designer. In addition, this could be a positive
        resource for those looking to learn a little bit about cars and wanting
        to get into the car world. This website will answer questions concerning
        my background in the automotive world, and show my interest in the
        field. Questions related to my experiences outside of that field will
        also be answered along the way. I am hoping that my audience will be
        interested in looking through all the pages on my site, learning more
        about me, but also hopefully about cars in general. I hope that the
        pictures will be helpful as a learning resource, but also as an
        entertainment form. I am hoping that the themes in this page will be
        visually pleasing and help the readers to enjoy the overall experience
        more. Research and brainstorming for different images and designs will
        be necessary, as well as finding a way to make this an informational
        resource about more than just me. In the context of a future employer,
        there will likely not be other resources available to get to know me.
        But in terms of people trying to learn more about cars, I'm hoping that
        this site can provide interesting insights that are simple to
        understand. I think that having many resources in one place will also be
        beneficial to them.

      <h4>About the Author</h4>
      <p>
        I am an Automotive Engineering Technology major at Brigham Young
        University- Idaho, currently in my Sophomore year. I grew up in
        Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, where I had five siblings and two wonderful
        parents. My fiance, Shay, and I will be married later this summer.
      </p>
      <p>
        My love for cars began on a family vacation, where my cousins and I
        would guess the car brand of an approaching vehicle. Ever since then,
        I've enjoyed spotting and identifying cars on the road and researching
        the newest models as they are released. I've also attended a number of
        motor shows, including the Harrisburg Auto Show, Corvettes at Carlisle,
        and Chrysler Nationals. I'm a proud owner of a 2010 Volvo XC70, and my
        dream car is a Lotus Evora 400.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        -The automobile has been around in some form since 1886, when German
        inventor Karl Benz created the Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
      </p>
      <p>
        -For over a decade, automobiles were seen as a toy for the rich, until
        Ford Motor Company, led by Henry Ford, created the Ford Model T in 1908.
        This vehicle revolutionized the car market, allowing automobile
        ownership to be available to the general populus instead of only the
        rich.
      </p>
      <p>
        -Cars continued to shift and change in shape and form until the WWII,
        when many automotive manufacturers shifted their resources towards the
        war effort. Their massive factories were used to manufacture tanks,
        weapons, planes, and other war-related vehicles.
      </p>
      <p>
        -While the war put a pause on the car market, many important
        developments came about as a result. Infrastructure expansion, coupled
        with improved engine, safety, and comfort technologies, increased
        popularity of the automobile in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
        -Gas crises in the 1970s led to further developments in the auto
        industry, shifting the focus from large gas-guzzling vehicles to
        smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles. Interest in hybrid, electric, and
        other alternative fuel types increased, and emissions regulations became
        more strict.
      </p>
      <p>
        -In the late 1990s and early 2000s, hybrid vehicles began to become more
        mainstream, through the introduction of models such as the Toyota Prius
        and Honda Insight.
      </p>
      <p>
        -Tesla Motors began selling the Model S in 2012, marking one of the
        first mainstream fully-electric vehicles. These hybrid and electric
        technologies have become staples of the modern car market, and many
        major manufacturers have plans to "electrify" their entire line of
        vehicles in the coming years.

        allowing for improved efficiency and reduced emissions. <br />

        external power source. <br />
